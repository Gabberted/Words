   About this page
   Our systems have detected unusual traffic from your computer network.
   This page checks to see if it's really you sending the requests, and
   not a robot. [1]Why did this happen?
   This page appears when Google automatically detects requests coming
   from your computer network which appear to be in violation of the
   [2]Terms of Service. The block will expire shortly after those requests
   stop. In the meantime, solving the above CAPTCHA will let you continue
   to use our services.
   This traffic may have been sent by malicious software, a browser
   plug-in, or a script that sends automated requests. If you share your
   network connection, ask your administrator for help — a different
   computer using the same IP address may be responsible. [3]Learn more
   Sometimes you may be asked to solve the CAPTCHA if you are using
   advanced terms that robots are known to use, or sending requests very
   quickly.

HTML For Absolute Beginners

   Welcome to the HTML.com's “Absolute Beginners” simple guide to HTML
   code.

   While many guides on the internet attempt to teach HTML using a lot of
   mind-boggling theory, this tutorial will instead focus on giving you
   the practical skills to build your first site.

   The aim is to show you ‘how’ to create your first web page without
   spending the entire tutorial focusing too much on the ‘why’. By the end
   of this tutorial, you will have the know-how to create a basic website
   and we hope that this will inspire you to delve further into the world
   of HTML using our follow-on guides.

What is HTML?

   Ok, so this is the only bit of mandatory theory. In order to begin to
   write HTML, it helps if you know what you are writing. HTML is the
   language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create
   pages and make them functional. The code used to make them visually
   appealing is known as CSS and we shall focus on this in a later
   tutorial. For now, we will focus on teaching you how to build rather
   than design.

The History of HTML

   HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990. It stands for Hyper
   Text Markup Language. Hypertext means that the document contains links
   that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document or to
   another document altogether. The latest version is known as [477]HTML5.

   A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to
   control how text is processed and presented.  To do this HTML uses two
   things: tags  and attributes.

What are Tags and Attributes?

What Are HTML Tags?

   [478]Tags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are
   usually enclosed in angle brackets. An example of a tag is: <h1>.

   Most tags must be opened  <h1>  and closed </h1> in order to function

What are HTML Attributes?

   [479]Attributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes
   take the form of an opening tag and additional info is placed inside.

   An example of an attribute is:

   <img src="mydog.gif" alt="A photo of my dog.">.

   In this instance, the image source (src) and the alt text  (alt) are
   attributes of the <img> tag.

Rules To Remember

    1. The vast majority of tags must be opened <Tag> and closed </Tag>
       with the element information such as a title or text resting
       between the tags.
    2. When using multiple tags, the tags must be closed in the order in
       which they were opened.

HTML Editors

   Now that we’ve gotten the basic theory out of the way. It’s time to
   learn how to build our first website.

   First off, we must ensure that we have the right tools. Most
   importantly, we need an HTML editor. There are many choices on the
   market such as the extremely popular [480]Notepad++.

   However, for this tutorial, we will use the [481]Bluefish Editor as it
   is free and also offers cross platform support for Windows, Mac, and
   Linux users.

   If you don't want to install any software, but want to preview code
   instantly — you can use an online HTML editor such as this simple
   [482]html5 editor.

   Do not use Microsoft Word or any other word processor when writing HTML
   code, only an HTML editor or at the very least, your machine’s built-in
   notepad, is suitable for the task.

   Secondly, ensure that you’ve installed a number of different browsers
   such as [483]Chrome and [484]Firefox in order to preview your upcoming
   creation.

Creating Your First HTML Webpage

   First off, you need to open your HTML editor, where you will find a
   clean white page on which to write your code. From there you need to
   layout your page with the following tags. These tags should be placed
   underneath each other at the top of every HTML page that you create.

   [485]<!DOCTYPE html>
   This tag specifies the language you will write on the page. In this
   case, the language is HTML 5.

   <HTML>
   This tag signals that from here on we are going to write in HTML code.

   Underneath the HTML we will open two further elements:
   [486]<Head>
   and
   [487]<Body>

   The content placed inside the <Head> tag is mostly designed to be read
   by search engines and other robots and is not for human consumption.
   This tag identifies your page to other computers and will decide where
   your content will be ranked in popular search engines including Google.

   Inside the <Head> tag we will open two further elements

   [488]<Title> This is where we insert the page name as it will appear at
   the top of the browser window.

   Let’s try it out:

   Write
   <title> My First Webpage </title> on a blank line in your HTML editor.

   Next, we will add the metadata, which is the information that search
   engines read about your site.

   This should follow the following format:

   <[489]meta charset="UTF-8">

   <[490]meta name="description" content="This field contains information
   about your page. It is usually around two sentences long.">.

   We can also create meta name attributes for “keywords”, “author” and
   other terms that you might want search engine bots to read.

   Let’s try it out:
   <meta charset="UTF-8">

   <meta name="description" content="This is my first website. It includes
   lots of information about my life.">

   Closing tag: </head>

   Next, we will make [491]<body> tag.

   The HTML<body> is where we add the content which is designed for
   viewing by human eyes. This includes text, images, tables, forms and
   everything else that we see on the internet each day.

How to Add HTML Headings (aka Headlines) To Your Web Page

   In HTML, [492]headings are written in the following elements:
     * <h1>
     * <h2>
     * <h3>
     * <h4>
     * <h5>
     * <h6>

   As you might have guessed <h1> and <h2> should be used for the most
   important while the remaining tags should be used for sub headings and
   less important text. Search engine bots use this order when deciphering
   which information is most important on a page.

   Let’s try it out:

   On a new line in the HTML editor, type

   <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>

   and hit save. We will save this file as “index.[493]html” in a new
   folder called “my webpage”.

   The Moment of Truth: Click the newly saved file and your first ever web
   page should open in your default browser. It may not be pretty it’s
   yours….all yours evil laugh.

   Well let’s now get carried away, we’ve still got loads of great
   features that we can add your page.

How To Add Text In HTML

   Adding text to our HTML page is simple using an element opened with the
   tag [494]<p> which creates a new paragraph. We place all of our regular
   text inside the element <p>.

   When we write text in HTML, we also have a number of other elements we
   can use to control the text or make it appear in a certain way.

   They are as follows:
     * [495]<b> – Bold text
     * [496]<strong> – Important text
     * [497]<i> – Italic text
     * [498]<em> – Emphasized text
     * [499]<mark> – Marked text
     * [500]<small> – Small text
     * [501]<del> – Deleted text
     * [502]<ins> – Inserted text
     * [503]<sub> – Subscript text
     * [504]<sup> – Superscript text

   These tags must be opened and closed around the text in question.

   For example:

   <p> This is where the text goes. Sometimes we mark it in
   <strong>bold</strong>. </p>

   Let’s try it out: On a new line in the HTML editor, type the following
   HTML code:

   <p> Welcome to <em> my </em> brand new website. This site will be my
   <strong> new <strong> home on the web. </p>

   Don’t forget to hit save and then refresh the page in your browser to
   see the results.

How To Add Links In HTML

   As you may have noticed, the internet is made up of lots of [505]links.
   Almost everything you click on while surfing the web is a link takes
   you to another page within the website you are visiting or to an
   external site.

   Links are included in an attribute opened by the [506]<a> tag. This
   element is the first that we’ve met which uses an attribute and so it
   looks different to previously mentioned tags.

   The <a> (or anchor) opening tag is written in the format:

   <[507]a href=“[508]https://blogging.com/how-to-start-a-blog/”>Your Link
   Text Here </a>

   The first part of the attribute points to the page that will open once
   the link is clicked. Meanwhile, the second part of the attribute
   contains the text which will be displayed to a visitor in order to
   entice them to click on that link.

   If you are building your own website then you will most likely host all
   of your pages on professional [509]web hosting. In this case, internal
   links on your website will <a href=“mylinkedpage.html”>Link Title Here
   </a>.

   Let’s try it out: Make a duplicate of the code from your current
   index.html page. Copy / paste it into a new window in your HTML editor.
   Save this new page as “page2.html” and ensure that it is saved in the
   same folder as your index.html page.

   On page2.html add the following code:

   <a href=“[510]http://www.google.com”>Google</a>

   This will create a link to Google on page 2.

   Hit save and return to your index.html page.

   On a new line on index.html add the following code:

   <a href=“/page2.html”>Page2</a>

   Hit save and preview index.html in your browser.

   If everything is correct then you will see a link which will take you
   to your second page. On the second page, there will be a link that will
   take you to google.com

How To Add Images In HTML To Your Website

   In today’s modern digital world, [511]images are everything. The
   [512]<img> tag has everything you need to display images on your site.
   Much like the <a> anchor element, <img> also contains an attribute. The
   attribute features information for your computer regarding the source,
   height, width and alt text of the image.

   You can also define borders and other styles around the image using the
   class attribute. However, we shall cover this in a later tutorial.

   The file types generally used for image files online are: .jpg, .png
   and .gif.

   Alt text is important to ensure that your site is ranked correctly on
   search sites and also for visually impaired visitors to your site.

   The [513]<img alt> attribute appears as follows:

   <img src=“yourimage.jpg" alt= “Describe the image” height="X"
   width="X">

   Let’s try it out: Save an image (.jpg, .png, .gif format) of your
   choice in the same folder where you’ve saved index.html and page2.html.
   Call this image “testpic.jpg”.

   On a new line In your HTML editor enter the following code:

   <img src=“testpic.jpg alt= “This is a test image” height="42"
   width="42">

   Hit save and preview the index.html page in your browser.

How To Make an HTML List

   In web design, there are 3 different types of lists which you may wish
   to add to your site.

Ordered List

   The first is [514]<ol>: This is an ordered list of contents. Eg.
    1. An item
    2. Another item
    3. Another goes here

   Inside the <ol> tag we list each item on the list inside [515]<li>
   </li> tags.

   For example:

   <ol>
   <li> An item </li>
   <li> Another item </li>
   <li>Another goes here </li>
   </ol>

Unordered List

   The second type of list that you may wish to include is a [516]<ul>
   unordered list. This is better known as a bullet point list and
   contains no numbers.

   An example of this is:

   <ul>
   <li> This is </li>
   <li> An Unordered </li>
   <li> List </li>
   </ul>

Definition List

   Finally, you may wish to include a definition list [517]<dl> on your
   page. An example of a <dl> list is as follows:

   HTML
          Hypertext markup language is a programming language used to
          create web pages, and is rendered by a web browser.

   The code used for the above is as follows:

   <dl>
   <dt>Item</dt>
   <dd>The definition goes here</dd>
   </dl>

   Let’s try it out: Open index.html and on a new line, enter the
   following HTML:

   <p> This website will have the following benefits for my business:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>Increased traffic </li>
   <li> Global Reach</li>
   <li> Promotional Opportunities</li>
   </ul>

   Now hit save and check out the results in your browser. If everything
   worked out then it will display a bullet pointed table displaying the
   information above.

How To Add Tables In HTML

   Another way to keep your website looking neat and orderly is through
   the use of a table. This is definitely the most complicated part of
   this tutorial, however, studying it will certainly pay off in the
   long-run.

   Important: Do not use a table to layout your website. Search engines
   hate it and it is generally a bad idea. Just…don't. See our [518]CSS
   tutorial, instead.

   With this in mind, tables can still be a useful way to present content
   on your page.

   When drawing a table we must open an element with the [519]<table>
   opening tag. Inside this tag we structure the table using the table
   rows, [520]<tr>, and cells, [521]<td>.

   An example of a HTML table is as follows:

   <table>
   <tr>
   <td>Row 1 - Column 1</td>
   <td> Row 1 - Colunm 2 </td>
   <td> Row 1 - Column 3 </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>Row 2 - Column 1</td>
   <td>Row 2 - Column 2</td>
   <td>Row 2 - Column 3</td>
   </tr>
   </table>

   This will produce a 2-row table with 3 cells in each row.

   [522]Tables can get quite complicated, so be sure to check out our
   special [523]HTML tables tutorial. However, watch out for these tags so
   that you can recognise them and use them as your skills develop:

   [524]<th> – Table header
   [525]<colgroup> – Column Group
   [526]<thead> – Table head
   [527]<tbody> – Table body
   [528]<tfoot> – Table foot

   Tables, borders, spacing are usually [529]styled using CSS but we will
   cover this in a later tutorial.

   Let’s try it out: Go to a new line on the index.html page within your
   text editor. Enter the following HTML code:

   <table>
   <tr>
   <td>Row 1 - Column 1</td>
   <td> Row 1 - Column 2 </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>Row 2 - Column 1</td>
   <td>Row 2 - Column 2</td>
   </tr>
   </table>

   Hit save and preview it in your browser.

   Congratulations: You did it!

How To Close an HTML Document

   You’ve reached the end of our absolute beginners HTML tutorial.

   The final step we need to complete is to close the <body> and <html>
   tags at the end of each page using the following HTML code:

   </body>
   </html>

   In this guide, you’ve learned how to create basic HTML web pages.
   You’ve also learned to add headings, text, images, links, lists and
   basic tables to these pages.

   You can now use this knowledge to create your own web pages containing
   these features and link them together. We suggest that you further
   enhance your skills by experimenting with the code you’ve learned using
   different variables. You may also wish to learn about intermediate HTML
   [530]elements or how to make your pages beautiful using [531]CSS.

   The power to create your own website is now in your hands.

Troubleshooting

   In case things didn’t work out as intended, simply check your HTML code
   against the examples below:

   Index.html troubleshooting code
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
   <title> My First Webpage </title>
   <meta charset="UTF-8">
   <meta name="description" content="This is my first website. It includes
   lots of information about my life.">
   </head>
   <body>
   <h1> Welcome to my webpage </h1>
   <p> Welcome to <em> my </em> brand new website. </p>
   <p>This site will be my <strong> new <strong> home on the web.</p>
   <a href=“/page2.html”>Page2</a>

HTML.com's Cheat Sheet

   If you need quick information about [532]particular tag or a specific
   [533]attribute, check out our [534]HTML cheat sheet. It's quick, easy,
   and alphabetized! Bookmark it for future reference.

Most Popular HTML Tags

   HTML, which stands for “HyperText Markup Language,” is the coding
   language for authoring web documents. “Tags” are simply codes that tell
   a web browser how to display a page. Below are some of the most common
   tags — used by nearly every website you encounter.

   [535]Headings
          Headings are a way to make text stand out by breaking up the
          page.

   [536]Paragraph
          Paragraphs determine line spacing.

   [537]Italics
          Create italics text just like in a word processor.

   [538]Bold
          Bold text emphasizes key words.

   [539]Anchor
          The anchor tag is most commonly used to create links in
          combination with the [540]Href attribute.

   [541]Unordered List
          Unnumbered lists of bullet points use the Unordered List tag.

   [542]List Item
          Each line on a list is enclosed by a List Item tag.

   [543]Blockquote
          Blockquote tags are used to enclose quotations from people. This
          tag helps to differentiate the quote from the text around it.

   [544]Horizontal Rule
          A horizontal rule is a straight line commonly used for dividing
          areas of a webpage.

   [545]Image
          Learn the image tag to find out how to code pictures into your
          page.

   [546]Division
          The Division tag defines specific layout styles within CSS.

Most Popular HTML Attributes

   What's the difference between a [547]tag and an [548]attribute? Simply
   put, attributes are a way to customize HTML tags. While a tag is a
   command in HTML, attributes describe the specifics of how the tag will
   be customized.

   [549]Alt
          The Alt attribute for the [550]Img tag indicates replacement
          text for images that might not load.

   [551]Href
          The Href attribute specifies the web address called for by an
          [552]Anchor (or “a”)tag.

   [553]Src
          The Src attribute specifies the file location of an image.

   [554]Style
          Style attributes describe layout information specified by
          [555]Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).

          directly to a visitor's device so that both humans and search
          crawlers get the maximum content from your site.

   [561]HTML5 Tutorial
          Even the web gets upgrades! HTML5 is the newest version of
